          How to Grow Hydroponic Mustard - Mustard is a vegetable that is quite
          often found in daily food dishes. Mustard is usually served as a
          complement to meatballs or directly stir-fried and served with hot
          rice.
          <br />
          <br />
          The texture of the crispy stems, the soft part of the leaves, and the
          characteristic taste in mustard greens are the main attraction. Not
          only that, mustard greens contain many nutrients such as folic acid,
          vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamin C.
          <br />
          <br />
          Hydroponic technique is a technique of growing plants with planting
          media other than soil. How to plant mustard greens is different from
          how to plant mustard in polybags. Well, just take a look at five easy
          ways to grow mustard greens with the hydroponic method below.
          <br />
          <br />
          1. Preparing Tools and Materials
          <br />
          <img

            className="img-fluid rounded-start align-items-center"
            style={{
              display: "block",
              marginLeft: "auto",
              marginRight: "auto",
            }}
          />

          <br />
          To get started, you will need an old plastic bottle of mineral water,
          a cutter, a knife, and scissors. While the materials you need to
          prepare are selected mustard seeds, wick, hydroponic nutrient
          solution, pipe or Styrofoam, and husk ash.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Preparing Planting Media and Nutrition
          <br />
          <img
            src="images/tips4.jpg"
            className="img-fluid rounded-start align-items-center"
            style={{
              display: "block",
              marginLeft: "auto",
              marginRight: "auto",
            }}
          />

          <br />
          After making sure all the tools and materials for growing mustard have
          been collected, you need to start preparing the growing media and
          hydroponic nutrients. Green mustard seeds that have been sown will
          later be planted in this media.
          <br />
          <br />
          First, divide two large plastic bottles. Then, cut the wick of the
          appropriate size to be inserted between the bottle caps that have been
          perforated.
          <br />
          <br />
          Make sure the wick is long enough to bridge the gap between the
          nutrients and the growing medium. If the wick has been installed, the
          next step is to put enough rice husk ash in the bottle that has a lid.
          <br />
          <br />
          Insert the top of the bottle (the husk) into the bottom of the bottle
          that has been filled with ready-to-use hydroponic nutrients. Make sure
          you provide support using a pipe or Styrofoam so that the top of the
          bottle does not touch the nutrient solution.
          <br />
          <br />
          Let the axis be the intermediate medium between the nutrients and the
          growing medium.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. Mustard Greens Nursery
          <br />

            className="img-fluid rounded-start align-items-center"
            style={{
              display: "block",
              marginLeft: "auto",
              marginRight: "auto",
            }}
          />
          <br />

          <br />
          Furthermore, the seeds that you have prepared will be sown first to
          become seeds. There are two options for seeding mustard seeds, namely
          on rockwool media or soil.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you want to use rockwool, the thing to do is to make holes in the
          container with a depth of approximately 3 cm with a distance of 1 cm
          between the holes. Meanwhile, if you want to do a seedling using soil,
          you have to mix soil and compost in a 2:1 ratio.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sowing should be done in a place that is not exposed to direct
          sunlight. You will find the seeds you planted begin to germinate on
          the third or fourth day. The characteristics of the seeds that are
          ready to be transferred are when the seeds have 2 to 3 leaves.
          <br />
          <br />
          4. Transferring Mustard Greens
          <br />
          <img
            src="images/tips6.jpg"
            className="img-fluid rounded-start align-items-center"
            style={{
              display: "block",
              marginLeft: "auto",
              marginRight: "auto",
            }}
          />
          <br />

          <br />
          If the seeds are ready to be moved, you can move them by inserting
          them into the husk ash media. You need to know, there is a possibility
          of stress on plants during the process of transferring seeds into the
          planting medium.
          <br />
          <br />
          Therefore, it is very important for you to include a little old
          planting media when transplanting seeds. This will help the mustard
          plant to carry out the adaptation process in the new planting medium.
          <br />
          <br />
          Equally important, make sure to move the mustard seeds carefully so
          that the roots are not damaged, OK, Toppers!
          <br />

          5. Caring for Green Mustard Plants
          <br />
          <img
            src="images/tips7.jpg"
            className="img-fluid rounded-start align-items-center"
            style={{
              display: "block",
              marginLeft: "auto",
              marginRight: "auto",
            }}
          />

          <br />
          How to care for mustard plants with the hydroponic method is very
          easy. The most important thing for you to pay attention to is the
          nutrient solution in the bottom bottle. The nutrient solution must
          always be filled so that the mustard greens do not run out of
          nutrients and grow longer or even die.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition, you need to water the mustard greens a day with a sprayer
          once a day. You can add various uses of pesticides both organic and
          chemical if needed.
          <br />
          <br />
          6. Harvest Mustard Greens

          When compared to the method of planting with soil, planting mustard
          with this hydroponic method will experience a shorter harvest period.
          You can harvest the mustard that you planted after approximately three
          months from the day of planting.
          <br />
          <br />
          Not only fast, how to grow mustard greens with hydroponics is very
          easy when harvesting. How to harvest it is quite simple, you just need
          to pull the mustard plant from the husk ash.
