          7 Ways to Overcome Pests
          <br />
          on Hydroponic Plants
        </h2>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "justify", textIndent: "10%" }}>
          <br />
          Derived from the root word Hydro which means water, hydroponic growing
          is a way of growing that uses water efficiently because it does not
          require as much water as conventionally grown plants. This is why this
          hydroponic method is very suitable for areas that have little water.
          <br />
          <br />
          It's just that, as mentioned earlier, there are still many who are
          confused about how to deal with pests on hydroponic plants. And if you
          have the same problem as most of them, now you don't have to worry
          about solving it anymore. Here are some ways to deal with pests on
          hydroponic plants that can help you:
          <br />
          <br />
          1. Defective Plant
          <br />
          <img
            src="images/tips1.jpg"
            className="img-fluid rounded-start align-items-center"
            style={{
              display: "block",
              marginLeft: "auto",
              marginRight: "auto",
            }}
          />
          <br />
          The first problem hydroponic growers face is defective plants. Almost
          all hydroponic farmers have experienced this, including farmers who
          use hydroponic growing with water media.
          <br />
          <br />
          How to Fix: To overcome the problem caused by these fleas, you can
          remove or destroy all infected plants so that their spread stops.
          <br />
          However, if the affected plant is not infected, you can clean the
          plant with warm water once a week. If you want to use a chemical
          method, you can spray the plants with malathion.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Hollow Leaf
          <br />
          There are many ways to grow hydroponics, one of which is by planting
          hydroponics with used bottles. It's just that, although it can be done
          with many media, the problem of hollow leaves has become a common
          problem that will be faced by hydroponic farmers. Usually, this
          disease is caused by attacks from caterpillars.
          <br />
          <br />
          Solution: There are two ways to deal with this caterpillar problem.
          First, check all parts of the plant and take out one by one the
          caterpillars that are there for destruction. Second, the chemical
          method, you can spray chemical liquid to all parts of the plant so
          that it can destroy the existing caterpillars directly.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. Rotten stalk
          <br />
          How to grow hydroponics with plastic cups can also be tried for those
          of you who are trying new things in agriculture. However, the problems
          faced must be the same as other hydroponic plants in general. One of
          the problems faced is stem rot which is more often caused by fungus.
          <br />
          <br />
          Solution: Prune or cut off the plant parts that are infested with
          fungus and ensure that your hydroponic plants get enough water.
          <br />
          <br />
          4. Yellowing Leaves
          <br />
          Just like the problem with how to grow hydroponics with bottles above,
          yellowing leaves is one of the problems that hydroponic farmers often
          face. However, this time it was more due to an attack from a white
          fly. Due to the attack, the leaves not only turn yellow but also
          wither.
          <br />
          <br />
          How to fix: Keep the plants away from the next white fly attack and
          clean the plants that have been affected by it with warm water and
          soap. If you want to use other methods such as using chemical methods,
          you can spray the plants with Malathion and Rotenone twice a week
          <br />
          <br />
          5. Withered Plant
          <br />
          <img
            src="images/tips2.jpg"
            className="img-fluid rounded-start align-items-center"
            style={{
              display: "block",
              marginLeft: "auto",
              marginRight: "auto",
            }}
          />
          <br />
          Different from how to deal with pests on hydroponic plants before,
          this time the problem came from white mites. As a result of this, your
          hydroponic plants can wither and the existing leaves fall, so you need
          special hydroponic plant care to deal with it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Treatment: White mites are usually seen on infected plant parts in a
          powdery form. To fix this you can use a liquid Malathion spray. It's
          just that, in some cases, sometimes the white mites can't be seen
          where to find them you need a magnifying glass or loop. This loop is
          not only useful for finding mites, it can also be used to find out
          whether your plants are affected by mites or not.
          <br />
          <br />
          6. Stem And Fruit Full of Holes
          <br />
          The problem that is often faced by hydroponic farmers is the plant
          stems are full of holes. Not only stems, holes are also commonly found
          in leaves and fruit. Usually this problem is caused by plants that are
          attacked by weevils.
          <br />
          <br />
          Solution: Because the weaver caterpillar is only active at night, so
          you can only solve this problem at night. Usually hydroponic farmers
          will destroy the borer caterpillars manually by taking them one by one
          using a flashlight as a means of lighting.
          <br />
          <br />
          7. Leaf tips are perforated and damaged
          <br />
          Hollowed and damaged leaves are common because of attacks from
          cockroaches or other insects.
          <br />
          <br />
          How to Overcome Pests on Hydroponic Plants: You can throw away damaged
          leaves immediately and spray your hydroponic plants with Malathion.
