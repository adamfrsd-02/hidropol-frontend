          Planting plants with the hydroponic method can be done for all
          horticultural plants, such as leafy vegetables, fruit vegetables,
          fruits, to ornamental plants. here are some horticultural plants that
          can be an option, quoted by VOI from various sources:
          <br />
          <br />
          1. Vegetables of a season There are many kinds of vegetables that can
          be grown using a hydroponic system. However, beginners are advised to
          choose one-season vegetables, namely plants that are planted to be
          harvested once by pulling them out, including kale, mustard greens,
          lettuce, and so on.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Plants that can absorb and store a lot of water Plants that can
          absorb and store a lot of water make it possible to provide nutrients
          to plants to the maximum. For types of plants that can store a lot of
          water, you can choose plants with wet stems, such as spinach, mustard
          greens or lettuce.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. Vegetables that have green leaves When planting green leafy
          vegetables, there are things that must be considered, namely the
          harvest time must be on time. The reason is, harvesting that is too
          early or past the normal harvest period can reduce the quality of
          vegetables. The ideal harvest time for green leafy vegetables is 26 to
          29 days.
          <br />
          <br />
          4. Fruit crops If you don't like growing vegetables, you can grow
          fruit plants using the hydroponic method. Some fruit plants that can
          be grown with a hydroponic system such as melons, strawberries, can
          also be vegetable plants such as tomatoes, chilies, eggplants, and so
          on. When growing fruit crops using the hydroponic method, make sure
          the plants have adequate nutritional needs and the availability of
          sunlight.
          <br />
          <br />
          5. Ornamental plants In addition to vegetables and fruits, ornamental
          plants or flowers can also be grown with a hydroponic system, aka
          without soil media. Types of plants that can be grown with this method
          are small ornamental plants such as cacti and orchids. For the pot,
          you can use an old bottle. The pot can be placed in the room and
          flower plants can be a decoration in the room.
